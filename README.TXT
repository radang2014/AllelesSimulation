PROJECT TITLE: BioSimulation
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Simulate the transferring of alleles (being A and S) to offspring under three different conditions.
VERSION or DATE: 5/6/2020
AUTHOR: Randy Dang
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Run the main method of either the Sim1, Sim2A, or Sim3A class depending on the conditions preferred. Open the .java file for any class to view the code for that class. Sim1 simulates a condition where there is no allele provides an advantage for survival. Sim2A simulates a condition where individuals homozygous for the S allele will not survive to have offspring (representing a homozygous recessive disease). Sim3A represents a condition like Sim2A, but there is a heterozygote advantage to individuals with one copy of each allele.
